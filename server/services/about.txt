Flow in 3-Layered Architecture:
- The client sends a request.
- The appropriate controller receives the request based on the URL.
- The controller calls the service to handle the incoming request.
- The service requests data from the repository to retrieve the necessary data.
- The service processes the data retrieved from the repository, and passes the data to the controller.
- The controller delivers the result (response) from the service to the client.


Service Layer handles the business logic of the app.
The data is transformed or calculated to meet the database modelâ€™s requirements before being sent to the server.
