Flow in 3-Layered Architecture:
- The client sends a request.
- The appropriate controller receives the request based on the URL.
- The controller calls the service to handle the incoming request.
- The service requests data from the repository to retrieve the necessary data.
- The service processes the data retrieved from the repository, and passes the data to the controller.
- The controller delivers the result (response) from the service to the client.



Data Access Layer (DAL) has access to the database to create, delete, or edit data.
It is where all the request and response from server logic is handled.
This layer may include Hypertext Transfer Protocol or
http requests to the server if there is no database connected directly into the app.
