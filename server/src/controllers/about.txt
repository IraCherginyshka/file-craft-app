Flow in 3-Layered Architecture:
- The client sends a request.
- The appropriate controller receives the request based on the URL.
- The controller calls the service to handle the incoming request.
- The service requests data from the repository to retrieve the necessary data.
- The service processes the data retrieved from the repository, and passes the data to the controller.
- The controller delivers the result (response) from the service to the client.


Controller Layer contains the app programming interface (API) routes of the app.
Its only job is to return a response from the server.
It deals with the request from the client and return the response of the server.
